# WordPress Heroku

This project is a template for installing and running [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/). The repository comes bundled with:
* [PostgreSQL for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/postgresql-for-wordpress/)
* [Cloudinary for non ephemeral Image and Video Storage](http://cloudinary.com/)
* [WP Sendgrid](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sendgrid/)
* [Disqus Commenting System](https://disqus.com/)
* [Wordpress HTTPS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-https/)

## Installation

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/rhildred/wordpress-heroku) to your own github
1. Create a new php app on on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/).
1. Add a heroku postgres database to your app
1. Deploy to Heroku from github
1. After deployment WordPress has a few more steps to setup the installation by visiting your app and thats it!

## Usage

Because a file cannot be written to Heroku's file system, updating and installing plugins or themes should be done locally and then pushed to Heroku.

Multimedia can also not be stored there for the same reasons. You will need to activate the cloudinary plugin and get your multimedia from cloudinary.

## Updating

Updating is pretty much guaranteed to fail. The postgres database connection won't survive the update. I have tried at various times to fix this and failed. You can see what I have tried on the master branch of this repository. There is definitely some security risk to using this. Only you can decide whether demonstrating your work for free is worth the risk of using outdated software.

Because this can't be updated to newer versions of wordpress newer plugins and themes may also refuse to run.

## Deployment optimisation

If you have files that you want tracked in your repo, but do not need deploying (for example, *.md, *.pdf, *.zip). Then add path or linux file match to the `.slugignore` file & these will not be deployed.

Examples:
```
path/to/ignore/
bin/
*.md
*.pdf
*.zip
```
